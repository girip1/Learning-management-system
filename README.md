# Software2Rep


Hello!

So this project is an effort of our team members (Tooba Hashmi, Puspa Giri, Hilario Lawerence, William Smithson, and Long Tong).

As it is the first project in which we used version control, it was difficult for us to understand how github works initally. This is a 
learning management system. A software program that helps university admins and faculty to create, manage, customize, 
and conglomerate student information on a large scale. This software product consists of two separate parts: a database component 
and a graphic user interface (GUI).  The database component performs the core functionality, such as creating, managing, and
delivering courses, authenticating users, and serving data, etc.  The program runs through a GUI to allow user friendly-ness,
which is used by administrators, professors, and students. The system allows admins to create content (student information, class 
section details, etc.), organize it into courses, enroll students to said courses, and finally, monitor and assess the students’
performances (assignments, grades, etc.).  Functions such as configuring the LMS, such as adding, editing, deleting, and monitoring 
student accounts, enrollment, courses, and staff members are under the jurisdiction of the administrators.  Faculty can also access 
the students’ progress.  Students can view the classes they’re enrolled in, their grades, and their final GPA.  

To run a working version on this program. You need only 3 files. 
You fill find them inside the zip folder labelled final submission project:
the SEproject.py file, student database, and gator.png file. In the absence of an established student database, 
the default admin login is
USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: 1234

Other than that; you will find copies of all our relevant artifacts and SPMP report as well.
